# cpu temp
Simple BATCH CPU TEMP monitor script with SMTP send through PoSH

It works if you are running it inside a Windows AD enviroment.
And if there are now SPF records on the domain used.

Or you can use full SMTP login.
Schedule it to run every 5minutes, and you will have your monitor :)

# ToDo
Add logging to file on send email
